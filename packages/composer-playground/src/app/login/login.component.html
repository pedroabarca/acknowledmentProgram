                <p>Avantica has a recognition system for the employees whose management is completely manual
                    called the Costa Rica Recognition Program. This introduces the possibility of points accounting errors,
                    or even the omission of acknowledgments by managers or the collaborators themselves.
                <p>On the other hand, there is no simple and self-service way for each employee to see their status
                    (accumulated points) throughout the period. Additionally, there are no established controls for the
                    inspection or assurance of recognition processes or points awarded to guarantee the reliability of
                    the results in each period.
                </p>
                <p>So the previous problem leads us to the need to develop an application based on Blockchain technology
                    which aims to cover and solve the problem in an effective way, for this, through a Smart Contract that
                    will seek to cover all regulations or rules that each of the 2 recognition categories possesses, all
                    of these, are within the policies already defined by the Costa Rica Recognition Program developed by Avantica.
                </p>
                <p>The projection of the tool is the development of a chain of blocks that allows a free, safe and honest
                    transfer of acknowledgments (certificates to recognize the good work or attitude of a co-worker).
                    The base of the network is blockchain, which gives us a degree of transfer and supervision that
                    cannot be easily implemented in a centralized database.
